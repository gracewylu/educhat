# educhat
This is a website that lets you talk to people in your college classes specifically. You have to be enrolled in that class to talk to the other people. It's anonymous so you don't know who is saying what. All you know is that they are also in your college class. But here's the twist, if you want to privately message someone, both you and that person have to accept and then you can see who you guys really are. Uses facebook integration and a .edu email address to check if you are in that class.

This is a project for SIUE eHacks
